# broth16

![](./broth16.jpg)

This is an exercise to learn how Groth16 works. Consider it a toy implementation. DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

## Curve

The curve used in this implementation is BLS12-381. It's also using my [toy implementation of asymmetric pairings on BLS12-381](https://github.com/kevincharm/blstoise).
